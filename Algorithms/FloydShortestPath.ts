    1. Floyd–Warshall’s Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph, where each edge 
       in the graph has a weight which is positive or negative.

    2. The biggest advantage of using this algorithm is that all the shortest distances between any 2 vertices could be calculated in O(V3), 
       where V is the number of vertices in a graph.

    3. Floyd-Warshall algorithm is also called as Floyd’s algorithm, Roy-Floyd algorithm, Roy-Warshall algorithm, or WFI algorithm.

    4. This algorithm follows the dynamic programming approach to find the shortest paths.
